## Installation

- ### Install Github Desktop
  Already familiar with git? Just make sure LFS is installed.

  Creating an ssh key is tricky for new users.<br>
  So download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), link it to your github account, it will automatically ssh for you and serve as a git repository manager.

- ### Download [Godot v3.4.4](https://godotengine.org/download/windows)
  Choose the Mono version (C# support).

- ### Install Visual Studio Community 2022
  You can choose any IDE with C# support but, for simplicity, we will install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
