## This document is made for people who donâ€™t understand why there is a Godot version of the game.

**TLDR**: Because I can. Go help the [Unity version](https://github.com/Layton-Fangame/Layton-Fangame).

**Disclaimer:**
>This document has nothing to do with the development of the game, it only serves to explain a point of view,
>it is in no way related to the contributors of the project.

>Owners, please do not delete the repository, thank you.

### The longer explanation:
First, put down your torches and pitchforks, and let me explain.

So, you must be thinking why there is another repo of the same game<a href="#bottom">*</a>. ***Because I can!***<br>
If you want to create a visual novel version of the game with Ren'Py, do it! Be free! ðŸ˜‰

#### Go help the unity version! It's a waste of time.
You're right It's a waste of ***my*** time.

#### It will make competition with the unity version
Absolutely not.<br>
I'm not making this because of spite.<br>
I donâ€™t want to compete nor replace the unity version.

#### Why not learn unity?
Because coding is hard, I am way more comfortable with Godot
and I don't want to waste my time learning something different when I already know how to use Godot.<br>

I know that the poll has chosen unity for the project,
Iâ€™m glad for you if you prefer unity, but what if the opposite happened
it would be a bit annoying for you to go back from zero.

#### It will duplicate the work!
I wonâ€™t lie, of course, will be kind of making the same thing<a href="#bottom">*</a>.<br>
But that's why Iâ€™m heavily working on the wiki to have a good structure, to be efficient for both projects.<br>
And wonâ€™t start the development with half of the documents done.

#### It will separate the team!
Yes but no, nearly half of the poll was in favour of Godot.<br>
So, they either learn unity or quit so in the end it doesnâ€™t make a difference (you will have enough people believe me ðŸ˜…)

### Conclusion
- So, I do not mean anything bad or mean doing this repo.
- Go help the [Unity version](https://github.com/Layton-Fangame/Layton-Fangame).
- If you do not want to code now. Please help with the wiki, I will be immensely grateful.
- If you still want to help, then, welcome! ðŸŽ‰

**\*** it's not quite the same, for example, I plan to add a portrait mode, which will **not** be in the unity version.
